## 👋 About Me

I’m a Software Engineering student at UTCN, passionate about building clean, efficient software and constantly improving my skills.  
I’m disciplined, ambitious, and highly driven — when I commit to something, I follow through until it’s done.  
I enjoy being part of a team, learning from others, and pushing myself to grow both personally and professionally.  
My goal is to develop strong technical foundations and become the kind of engineer who delivers real value through well-crafted solutions.
